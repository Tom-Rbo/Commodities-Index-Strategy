Commodities Index Strategy  

**Overview**  
This repository presents a project developed during the Commodities Markets and Models course at ESILV (4th year, Financial Engineering major, 2024â€“2025). 
The goal is to design a systematic investment strategy using a custom index composed of various commodity assets.
The strategy dynamically allocates long and/or short positions in individual commodity indices based on historical data and the concept of mean reversion.

**Project Objectives**
- Construct a commodity index strategy.
- Utilize historical daily data for over a dozen commodities.
- Analyze performance and assess the effectiveness of the strategy since 2023.
